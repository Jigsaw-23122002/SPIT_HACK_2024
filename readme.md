## üìùDescription

- **Copyright Protection** : Copyright Infringement and Lack of Transparency while tackling piracy is a major issue in traditional systems

- **IPR & Royalty** : The art forms are an intellectual property of the artists. In traditional systems, the intermediaries (like TSeries for musicians) exploit the intellectual property for profitability, barring the artist of the deserved royalty.
- **Tokenization of Art** :  Art forms should be represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain as a digital asset
